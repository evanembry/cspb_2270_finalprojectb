# Evan Embry - Jukebox App 
# The Doubly linked list data structure is implemented. 
# This data structure is a linked list of nodes containing data where each node is connected to its previous node and next node. This list has a head and tail as well. 
# Instructions:
# 1. Navigate to build directory. 
# 2. Run the executable with command line statement "./run_app"
# 3. Navigate through the command line user interface and press the number option of your choice. 
# 4. When first navigating through the user control, be sure to create or select a playlist first before adding a new song. 
# 5. Enjoy! Thank you for trying out my Jukebox application.
